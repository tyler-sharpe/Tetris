# Features
- 10 levels, each sporting a class retro video game soundtrack
- A local leaderboard to track your scores overtime!
- 3 difficulty settings (easy / medium / hard)
- Support for 'Hold' blocks
- A time-attack mode which restricts the amount of time allowed for each level
- Toggleable special blocks which provide a point bonus per lines cleared
- 'Ghost Square' outline showing where the block would be placed if insta-dropped

# Building / Running
The game is built as a JAR file. To build, simply run `gradlew jar` from the root of this project.
This will produce a **Tetris.jar** file in `build/libs`. Then, just launch the JAR file to play!
